	Journal entry 1:So far I am just learning the basics. I have an idea for a good codesketch, where I can
do a fun coin flipping game. In terms of what I have learned, I have learned a lot. At the start of this class, my knowledge on coding was non-existent, unless you count scratch (which I donâ€™t). I have learned how to do the basics of html, such as creating divs and do a styling section. Things I want to work on in the next trimester, is being able to be more independent, and practicing the basics. I think I want to focus more on how to use Javascript, and work on more codesketches because I am having trouble with that. Positioning is also still somewhat complicated, and I want to reinforce those skills as well. 

 Journal entry 2: I have started on my coin flip game and I have the coin flipping, but I don't know how to randomize the outcome yet. 

 Journal entry 3: The coin flip game is going better now, I had a lab with Molly and I have mapped out what I want to do. I also plan do to something with my favorie songs, using if else statements.

 Journal entry 4:
 I am now working on doing a codesketch with some of my favorite songs, where when you click on the image for the song, the song will then start playing.
