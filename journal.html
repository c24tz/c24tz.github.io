	Journal entry 1:So far I am just learning the basics. I have an idea for a good codesketch, where I can
do a fun coin flipping game. In terms of what I have learned, I have learned a lot. At the start of this class, my knowledge on coding was non-existent, unless you count scratch (which you donâ€™t). I have learned how to do the basics of html, such as creating divs and do a styling section. Things I want to work on in the next trimester, is being able to be more independent, and practicing the basics. I think I want to focus more on how to use Javascript, and work on more codesketches because I am having trouble with that. Positioning is also still somewhat complicated, and I want to reinforce those skills as well.
